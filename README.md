Thanks for checking out my github page! I'm mostly interested in applications of AI and cybersecurity, but I am still interested in lots of other things. I am most experienced in Python and Java, but I also have experience with Webapps, Bash, Networking, and the Linux filesystem! I love discovering new open source projects and I am always looking to learn more, so feel free to leave suggestions on my pages!
